# CoffeeDielectric10Mhz
Dielectric measurement of coffee using defined volume and plate capacitor


The measurement takes place in a defined volume of 75x50mm with a distance of 20mm between the capacitor plates. 
Frequency sweep is used to determine resonant frequency of parralel oscillator (1mH inductor parallel to coffee)

Using: 
ADALM2000 as frecuency generator and data acqusition system
